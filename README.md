## Development log
### 1/2/19:
#### William:
* Initialized the project by making the entry point class (Main.java and Head.java), .gitignore.
* Can convert the given terminal argument into a java.nio.Path
* Made the CSV cell and made the toString() to format the data correctly.
#### Samson:
* Finished mode, mean , median, sort, range, max, min , sum untested
### 1/3/19:

* Can convert a string representation of the cell into a cell
#### Samson
* Changed the sort method from bubble sort to default java sort
* Tested all the methods using a driver I made
* Wrote count and product
### 1/4/19:

#### William:
* Made static factory method and private constructor to make creating new instances easier.
